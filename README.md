# The Specificity Project

This project uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to shed light on the different meanings of the word "specificity" in biology. It began as a research project at [The Pence Lab](https://pencelab.be/).

## Background

One thing that philosophers of science do is identify concepts in science that look interesting or important, and attempt to spell out in detail their meaning and scientific role. Sometimes, they even rework the concept to apply at a more abstract level, in the hope if identifying certain common patterns between different scientific fields that have gone unnoticed.

A recent example of this conceptual analysis in philosophy of biology is the concept of _specificity_.
