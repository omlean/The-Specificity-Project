# The Specificity Project

This project uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to shed light on the different meanings of the word "specificity" in biology, focusing on the entire history of Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Data from Proceedings of the Royal Society B appear via agreement between the [evoText](www.evotext.org)/[Sciveyor](www.sciveyor.com) project and [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/)."



## Background

One thing that philosophers of science do is clarify scientific concepts: Take an interesting and important concept in science, and attempting to spell out in detail exactly what it means and why it's important. Sometimes, they even rework or refine the concept so that it can potentially generalize to other scientific areas, in the hope if identifying certain common patterns between those areas that have gone unnoticed.

A recent example of this conceptual analysis in philosophy of biology is the concept of _specificity_. This concept has been at the centre of a recent debate about genetic causation. Everyone agrees that genes aren't the only thing that affect how organisms develop: this is really an extremely complex set of interactions between genes and environment. But despite this, biologists tend to focus a lot of attention on genes. Is this because they play a particularly special role in development? If so, how do we spell out this role? One suggestion is that genes are special and worthy of a lot of attention because their role is highly _specific_: they determine the sequence of proteins in a particulary fine-grained way.

However this debate turns out, it has an unintended result: It focuses on a very particular meaning of "specificity", and someone focusing on this literature might get the impression that it's the most significant, or even the only, sense of "specificity" in biology. But this isn't true: the sense of "specificity" used in molecular biology is [different](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706093?af=R) from the one in the above debate.

This raises a question: **How many meanings does "specificity" actually have in biology**? Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be an important tool for getting traction on this question.
